# OpenAI Agents SDK


<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! -->

- Agents represent systems that intelligently **accomplish tasks**,
  ranging from executing simple workflows to pursuing **complex,
  open-ended objectives**.

- OpenAI provides a rich set of **composable primitives** that enable
  you to build agents, including models, tools, knowledge and memory,
  audio and speech, orchestration, and voice agents etc;

``` python
import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings("ignore")
```

## Build the most fundamental (yet very powerful) agent

``` python
from agents import Agent, Runner, WebSearchTool
```

The most common properties of an agent you’ll configure are:

- `name` : A required string that identifies your agent.
- `instructions` : also known as a developer message or system prompt.
- `model` : which LLM to use, and optional model_settings to configure
  model tuning parameters like temperature, top_p, etc.
- `tools` : Tools that the agent can use to achieve its tasks.

``` python
#Define the agent; 
agent = Agent(
    name="airnz_oscar",
    instructions="You are a customer service agent of Air New Zealand. You must the use web search tool to source information for every customer's question. Please only use information from the websites that contains the Air New Zealand domain - https://www.airnewzealand.co.nz/",
    tools=[
        WebSearchTool(),]
)
```

You can run agents via the Runner class. You have 3 options:

- `Runner.run()`, which runs async and returns a RunResult.
- `Runner.run_sync()`, which is a sync method and just runs .run() under
  the hood.
- `Runner.run_streamed()`, which runs async and returns a
  RunResultStreaming. It calls the LLM in streaming mode, and streams
  those events to you as they are received.

``` python
result = await Runner.run(
    agent,
    "I am flying from Melbourne to Auckland. My ticket class is seat-only. "
    "How many bags can I check through?"
)
print(result.final_output)
```

    For your flight from Melbourne to Auckland with a Seat fare, you are entitled to one carry-on bag weighing up to 7kg (15lb), along with one small personal item, such as a handbag or thin laptop bag. ([airnewzealand.com](https://www.airnewzealand.com/carry-on-baggage?utm_source=openai)) Checked baggage is not included with the Seat fare. If you require checked baggage, you can upgrade to a Seat+Bag fare, which includes one checked bag up to 23kg (50lb). ([airnewzealand.co.nz](https://www.airnewzealand.co.nz/short-haul-fares?utm_source=openai)) 

### Running the agent aka - the agent loop

When you use the run method in Runner, you pass in a starting agent and
input. The input can either be a string (which is considered a user
message), or a list of input items, which are the items in the OpenAI
Responses API.

The runner then runs a loop:

We call the LLM for the current agent, with the current input. The LLM
produces its output.

- If the LLM returns a final_output, the loop ends and we return the
  result.
- If the LLM does a handoff, we update the current agent and input, and
  re-run the loop.
- If the LLM produces tool calls, we run those tool calls, append the
  results, and re-run the loop.

If we exceed the `max_turns` passed, we raise a MaxTurnsExceeded
exception.

#### Configurations when running the agent

The `run_config` parameter lets you configure some global settings for
the agent run:

- `model`: Allows setting a global LLM model to use, irrespective of
  what model each Agent has.
- `model_provider`: A model provider for looking up model names, which
  defaults to OpenAI.
- `model_settings`: Overrides agent-specific settings. For example, you
  can set a global temperature or top_p.
- `input_guardrails`, output_guardrails: A list of input or output
  guardrails to include on all runs.
- `handoff_input_filter`: A global input filter to apply to all
  handoffs, if the handoff doesn’t already have one. The input filter
  allows you to edit the inputs that are sent to the new agent. See the
  documentation in Handoff.input_filter for more details.
- `tracing_disabled`: Allows you to disable tracing for the entire run.
- `trace_include_sensitive_data`: Configures whether traces will include
  potentially sensitive data, such as LLM and tool call inputs/outputs.
- `workflow_name`, `trace_id`, `group_id`: Sets the tracing workflow
  name, trace ID and trace group ID for the run. We recommend at least
  setting workflow_name. The group ID is an optional field that lets you
  link traces across multiple runs.
- `trace_metadata`: Metadata to include on all traces.

#### Conversations/chat threads

Calling any of the run methods can result in one or more agents running
(and hence one or more LLM calls), but it represents a single logical
turn in a chat conversation. For example:

- User turn: user enter text
- Runner run: first agent calls LLM, runs tools, does a handoff to a
  second agent, second agent runs more tools, and then produces an
  output.

At the end of the agent run, you can choose what to show to the user.
For example, you might show the user every new item generated by the
agents, or just the final output. Either way, the user might then ask a
followup question, in which case you can call the run method again.

> You can decide when to hand over to a human agent using conversation
> turns; You can choose to show the all the running items of the agents
> instead of final output to give more visibility to the customers from
> the product design or user experience perspective;

``` python
# manual conversation management
async def main():
    agent = Agent(name="Assistant", instructions="Reply very concisely.")

    with trace(workflow_name="Conversation", group_id=thread_id):
        # First turn
        result = await Runner.run(agent, "What city is the Golden Gate Bridge in?")
        print(result.final_output)
        # San Francisco

        # Second turn
        new_input = result.to_input_list() + [{"role": "user", "content": "What state is it in?"}]
        result = await Runner.run(agent, new_input)
        print(result.final_output)
        # California
```

``` python
#Automatic conversation management with Sessions
#For a simpler approach, you can use Sessions to automatically handle conversation history without manually calling .to_input_list():
from agents import Agent, Runner, SQLiteSession

async def main():
    agent = Agent(name="Assistant", instructions="Reply very concisely.")

    # Create session instance
    session = SQLiteSession("conversation_123")

    with trace(workflow_name="Conversation", group_id=thread_id):
        # First turn
        result = await Runner.run(agent, "What city is the Golden Gate Bridge in?", session=session)
        print(result.final_output)
        # San Francisco

        # Second turn - agent automatically remembers previous context
        result = await Runner.run(agent, "What state is it in?", session=session)
        print(result.final_output)
        # California
```

#### how does session in SDK work

When session memory is enabled:

- Before each run: The runner automatically retrieves the conversation
  history for the session and prepends it to the input items.
- After each run: All new items generated during the run (user input,
  assistant responses, tool calls, etc.) are automatically stored in the
  session.
- Context preservation: Each subsequent run with the same session
  includes the full conversation history, allowing the agent to maintain
  context.

This eliminates the need to manually call .to_input_list() and manage
conversation state between runs.

### Memory Operations

> Basic operations - Sessions supports several operations for managing
> conversation history:

``` python
from agents import SQLiteSession

session = SQLiteSession("user_123", "conversations.db")

# Get all items in a session
items = await session.get_items()

# Add new items to a session
new_items = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "Hello"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hi there!"}
]
await session.add_items(new_items)

# Remove and return the most recent item
last_item = await session.pop_item()
print(last_item)  # {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hi there!"}

# Clear all items from a session
await session.clear_session()
```

> The pop_item method is particularly useful when you want to undo or
> modify the last item in a conversation

#### SQLMemory

``` python
from agents import SQLiteSession

# In-memory database (lost when process ends)
session = SQLiteSession("user_123")

# Persistent file-based database
session = SQLiteSession("user_123", "conversations.db")

# Use the session
result = await Runner.run(
    agent,
    "Hello",
    session=session
)
```

#### Multiple sessions

``` python
from agents import Agent, Runner, SQLiteSession

agent = Agent(name="Assistant")

# Different sessions maintain separate conversation histories
session_1 = SQLiteSession("user_123", "conversations.db")
session_2 = SQLiteSession("user_456", "conversations.db")

result1 = await Runner.run(
    agent,
    "Hello",
    session=session_1
)
result2 = await Runner.run(
    agent,
    "Hello",
    session=session_2
)
```

#### Custom memory implementations

> You can implement your own session memory by creating a class that
> follows the `Session` protocol:

``` python
from agents.memory import Session
from typing import List

class MyCustomSession:
    """Custom session implementation following the Session protocol."""

    def __init__(self, session_id: str):
        self.session_id = session_id
        # Your initialization here

    async def get_items(self, limit: int | None = None) -> List[dict]:
        """Retrieve conversation history for this session."""
        # Your implementation here
        pass

    async def add_items(self, items: List[dict]) -> None:
        """Store new items for this session."""
        # Your implementation here
        pass

    async def pop_item(self) -> dict | None:
        """Remove and return the most recent item from this session."""
        # Your implementation here
        pass

    async def clear_session(self) -> None:
        """Clear all items for this session."""
        # Your implementation here
        pass

# Use your custom session
agent = Agent(name="Assistant")
result = await Runner.run(
    agent,
    "Hello",
    session=MyCustomSession("my_session")
)

## Session management

### Session ID naming

Use meaningful session IDs that help you organize conversations:

-   User-based: `"user_12345"`
-   Thread-based: `"thread_abc123"`
-   Context-based: `"support_ticket_456"`

### Memory persistence

-   Use in-memory SQLite (`SQLiteSession("session_id")`) for temporary conversations
-   Use file-based SQLite (`SQLiteSession("session_id", "path/to/db.sqlite")`) for persistent conversations
-   Consider implementing custom session backends for production systems (Redis, PostgreSQL, etc.)

### Session management

```python
# Clear a session when conversation should start fresh
await session.clear_session()

# Different agents can share the same session
support_agent = Agent(name="Support")
billing_agent = Agent(name="Billing")
session = SQLiteSession("user_123")

# Both agents will see the same conversation history
result1 = await Runner.run(
    support_agent,
    "Help me with my account",
    session=session
)
result2 = await Runner.run(
    billing_agent,
    "What are my charges?",
    session=session
)
```

## Expand the agent capabilities with “functions”

``` python
from agents import Agent, FunctionTool, function_tool

@function_tool  
async def cancel_flight() -> str:
    
    """cancel the customer's flight as long as they request.

    """
    # In real life, we'd fetch the weather from a weather API
    return "you flight is successfully cancelled"
```

``` python
agent = Agent(
    name="airnz_oscar",
    instructions="""You are a customer service agent of Air New Zealand. 
    If the questions are seeking informetion, You must the use web search tool to source information for every customer's question. Please only use information from the websites that contains the Air New Zealand domain - https://www.airnewzealand.co.nz/.
    If the customers ask to cancel their flights, you always run the cancel_flight function""",
    tools=[cancel_flight, WebSearchTool()],
)
```

``` python
result = await Runner.run(
    agent,
    "I am flying from Melbourne to Auckland. My ticket class is seat-only. "
    "How many bags can I check through?"
)
print(result.final_output)
```

    For your flight from Melbourne to Auckland with a Seat Only fare, you are entitled to one carry-on bag weighing up to 7 kg (15 lb) and one small personal item, such as a handbag or slim laptop bag. Checked baggage is not included in the Seat Only fare. If you need to check in luggage, you can purchase a Prepaid Extra Bag before your flight. Each checked bag can weigh up to 23 kg (50 lb). ([airnewzealand.co.nz](https://www.airnewzealand.co.nz/short-haul-fares?utm_source=openai), [airnewzealand.co.nz](https://www.airnewzealand.co.nz/checked-in-baggage?utm_source=openai)) 

``` python
result = await Runner.run(
    agent,
    "I am flying from Melbourne to Auckland. My ticket class is seat-only. Unfortunately I would like to cancel it."
)
print(result.final_output)
```

    Your flight from Melbourne to Auckland with a seat-only ticket has been successfully canceled. If you need further assistance, feel free to ask!

> A very useful trick to save month and reduce latency

``` python
from agents.agent import StopAtTools 
agent = Agent(
    name="airnz_oscar",
    instructions="""You are a customer service agent of Air New Zealand. 
    If the questions are seeking informetion, You must the use web search tool to source information for every customer's question. Please only use information from the websites that contains the Air New Zealand domain - https://www.airnewzealand.co.nz/.
    If the customers ask to cancel their flights, you always run the cancel_flight function""",
    tools=[cancel_flight, WebSearchTool()],
    tool_use_behavior=StopAtTools(stop_at_tool_names=["cancel_flight"]),
)

result = await Runner.run(
    agent,
    "I am flying from Melbourne to Auckland. My ticket class is seat-only. Unfortunately I would like to cancel it."
)
print(result.final_output)
```

    you flight is successfully cancelled

## Expand the agent capabilities with “context”

Context is an overloaded term. There are two main classes of context you
might care about:

- Context available locally to your code: this is data and dependencies
  you might need when tool functions run, during callbacks like
  on_handoff, in lifecycle hooks, etc.
- Context available to LLMs: this is data the LLM sees when generating a
  response.

**Local context**

This is represented via the RunContextWrapper class and the context
property within it. The way this works is:

- You create any Python object you want. A common pattern is to use a
  dataclass or a Pydantic object.
- You pass that object to the various run methods (e.g. Runner.run(…,
  **context=whatever**)).
- All your tool calls, lifecycle hooks etc will be passed a wrapper
  object, RunContextWrapper\[T\], where T represents your context object
  type which you can access via wrapper.context.

The **most important thing** to be aware of: every agent, tool function,
lifecycle etc for a given agent run must use the same type of context.

You can use the context for things like:

- Contextual data for your run (e.g. things like a username/uid or other
  information about the user)
- Dependencies (e.g. logger objects, data fetchers, etc)
- Helper functions

``` python
import asyncio
from dataclasses import dataclass

from agents import Agent, RunContextWrapper, Runner, function_tool

@dataclass
class UserInfo:  
    name: str
    uid: int

@function_tool
async def fetch_user_age(wrapper: RunContextWrapper[UserInfo]) -> str:  
    """Fetch the age of the user. Call this function to get user's age information."""
    return f"The user {wrapper.context.name} is 47 years old"


user_info = UserInfo(name="John", uid=123)

agent = Agent[UserInfo](  
        name="Assistant",
        tools=[fetch_user_age],
    )

result = await Runner.run(  
        starting_agent=agent,
        input="What is the name of the user and how old is the user?",
        context=user_info,
    )

print(result.final_output)
```

    The user's name is John, and he is 47 years old.

**Agent/LLM context**

When an LLM is called, the only data it can see is from the conversation
history. This means that if you want to make some new data available to
the LLM, you must do it in a way that makes it available in that
history. There are a few ways to do this:

- You can add it to the Agent instructions. This is also known as a
  “system prompt” or “developer message”. System prompts can be static
  strings, or they can be dynamic functions that receive the context and
  output a string. This is a common tactic for information that is
  always useful (for example, the user’s name or the current date).
- Add it to the input when calling the Runner.run functions. This is
  similar to the instructions tactic, but allows you to have messages
  that are lower in the chain of command.
- Expose it via function tools. This is useful for on-demand context -
  the LLM decides when it needs some data, and can call the tool to
  fetch that data.
- Use retrieval or web search. These are special tools that are able to
  fetch relevant data from files or databases (retrieval), or from the
  web (web search). This is useful for “grounding” the response in
  relevant contextual data.

## Make your agents more secure through “guardrails”

Guardrails run in parallel to your agents, enabling you to do checks and
validations of user input. For example, imagine you have an agent that
uses a very smart (and hence slow/expensive) model to help with customer
requests. You wouldn’t want malicious users to ask the model to help
them with their math homework. So, you can run a guardrail with a
fast/cheap model. If the guardrail detects malicious usage, it can
immediately raise an error, which stops the expensive model from running
and saves you time/money.

There are two kinds of guardrails:

- Input guardrails run on the initial user input
- Output guardrails run on the final agent output

### Input guardrails

Input guardrails run in 3 steps:

- First, the guardrail receives the same input passed to the agent.
- Next, the guardrail function runs to produce a
  GuardrailFunctionOutput, which is then wrapped in an
  InputGuardrailResult
- Finally, we check if .tripwire_triggered is true. If true, an
  InputGuardrailTripwireTriggered exception is raised, so you can
  appropriately respond to the user or handle the exception.

### Output guardrails

Output guardrails run in 3 steps:

- First, the guardrail receives the output produced by the agent.
- Next, the guardrail function runs to produce a
  GuardrailFunctionOutput, which is then wrapped in an
  OutputGuardrailResult
- Finally, we check if .tripwire_triggered is true. If true, an
  OutputGuardrailTripwireTriggered exception is raised, so you can
  appropriately respond to the user or handle the exception.

> If the input or output fails the guardrail, the Guardrail can signal
> this with a tripwire. As soon as we see a guardrail that has triggered
> the tripwires, we immediately raise a
> `{Input,Output}GuardrailTripwireTriggered` exception and halt the
> Agent execution.

## Add tracing to your agents to observe and optimize your agents

The Agents SDK includes built-in tracing, collecting a comprehensive
record of events during an agent run: LLM generations, tool calls,
handoffs, guardrails, and even custom events that occur. Using the
Traces dashboard, you can debug, visualize, and monitor your workflows
during development and in production.

Tracing is enabled by default. There are two ways to disable tracing:

- You can globally disable tracing by setting the env var
  OPENAI_AGENTS_DISABLE_TRACING=1
- You can disable tracing for a single run by setting
  agents.run.RunConfig.tracing_disabled to True

> **For organizations operating under a Zero Data Retention (ZDR) policy
> using OpenAI’s APIs, tracing is unavailable.**

By default, the SDK traces the following:

- The entire Runner.{run, run_sync, run_streamed}() is wrapped in a
  trace().
- Each time an agent runs, it is wrapped in `agent_span()`
- LLM generations are wrapped in `generation_span()`
- Function tool calls are each wrapped in `function_span()`
- Guardrails are wrapped in `guardrail_span()`
- Handoffs are wrapped in `handoff_span()`
- Audio inputs (speech-to-text) are wrapped in a `transcription_span()`
- Audio outputs (text-to-speech) are wrapped in a `speech_span()`
- Related audio spans may be parented under a `speech_group_span()`
- By default, the trace is named “Agent trace”. You can set this name if
  you use trace, or you can can configure the name and other properties
  with the RunConfig.

``` python
from agents import Agent, Runner, trace

async def main():
    agent = Agent(name="Joke generator", instructions="Tell funny jokes.")

    with trace("Joke workflow"): 
        first_result = await Runner.run(agent, "Tell me a joke")
        second_result = await Runner.run(agent, f"Rate this joke: {first_result.final_output}")
        print(f"Joke: {first_result.final_output}")
        print(f"Rating: {second_result.final_output}")
```

### Sensitive data

Certain spans may capture potentially sensitive data.

- The generation_span() stores the inputs/outputs of the LLM generation,
  and function_span() stores the inputs/outputs of function calls. These
  may contain sensitive data, so you can disable capturing that data via
  RunConfig.trace_include_sensitive_data.

- Similarly, Audio spans include base64-encoded PCM data for input and
  output audio by default. You can disable capturing this audio data by
  configuring VoicePipelineConfig.trace_include_sensitive_audio_data.

### Custom tracing processors

The high level architecture for tracing is:

- At initialization, we create a global TraceProvider, which is
  responsible for creating traces. We configure the TraceProvider with a
  BatchTraceProcessor that sends traces/spans in batches to a
  BackendSpanExporter, which exports the spans and traces to the OpenAI
  backend in batches. To customize this default setup, to send traces to
  alternative or additional backends or modifying exporter behavior, you
  have two options:

- `add_trace_processor()` lets you add an additional trace processor
  that will receive traces and spans as they are ready. This lets you do
  your own processing in addition to sending traces to OpenAI’s backend.

- `set_trace_processors()` lets you replace the default processors with
  your own trace processors. This means traces will not be sent to the
  OpenAI backend unless you include a TracingProcessor that does so.

## Let’s go to the multi-agents

### Hands-offs

- Handoffs allow an agent to delegate tasks to another agent. This is
  particularly useful in scenarios where different agents specialize in
  distinct areas. For example, a customer support app might have agents
  that each specifically handle tasks like order status, refunds, FAQs,
  etc.

- Handoffs are represented as tools to the LLM. So if there’s a handoff
  to an agent named Refund Agent, the tool would be called
  transfer_to_refund_agent.

``` python
# Basic usage
from agents import Agent, handoff

billing_agent = Agent(name="Billing agent")
refund_agent = Agent(name="Refund agent")


triage_agent = Agent(name="Triage agent", handoffs=[billing_agent, handoff(refund_agent)])
```

### Customizing handoffs via the `handoff()` function

The handoff() function lets you customize things.

- `agent`: This is the agent to which things will be handed off.
- `tool_name_override`: By default, the Handoff.default_tool_name()
  function is used, which resolves to transfer_to\_<agent_name>. You can
  override this.
- `tool_description_override`: Override the default tool description
  from Handoff.default_tool_description()
- `on_handoff`: A callback function executed when the handoff is
  invoked. This is useful for things like kicking off some data fetching
  as soon as you know a handoff is being invoked. This function receives
  the agent context, and can optionally also receive LLM generated
  input. The input data is controlled by the input_type param.
- `input_type`: The type of input expected by the handoff (optional).
- `input_filter`: This lets you filter the input received by the next
  agent. See below for more.

``` python
from agents import Agent, handoff, RunContextWrapper

def on_handoff(ctx: RunContextWrapper[None]):
    print("Handoff called")

agent = Agent(name="My agent")

handoff_obj = handoff(
    agent=agent,
    on_handoff=on_handoff,
    tool_name_override="custom_handoff_tool",
    tool_description_override="Custom description",
)
```

### Hand-off inputs

In certain situations, you want the LLM to provide some data when it
calls a handoff. For example, imagine a handoff to an “Escalation
agent”. You might want a reason to be provided, so you can log it.

``` python
from pydantic import BaseModel

from agents import Agent, handoff, RunContextWrapper

class EscalationData(BaseModel):
    reason: str

async def on_handoff(ctx: RunContextWrapper[None], input_data: EscalationData):
    print(f"Escalation agent called with reason: {input_data.reason}")

agent = Agent(name="Escalation agent")

handoff_obj = handoff(
    agent=agent,
    on_handoff=on_handoff,
    input_type=EscalationData,
)
```

### Input filters

When a handoff occurs, it’s as though the new agent takes over the
conversation, and gets to see the entire previous conversation history.
If you want to change this, you can set an input_filter. An input filter
is a function that receives the existing input via a HandoffInputData,
and must return a new HandoffInputData.

There are some common patterns (for example removing all tool calls from
the history), which are implemented for you in
`agents.extensions.handoff_filters`

``` python
from agents import Agent, handoff
from agents.extensions import handoff_filters

agent = Agent(name="FAQ agent")

handoff_obj = handoff(
    agent=agent,
    input_filter=handoff_filters.remove_all_tools, 
)
```

### Handpff prompts

To make sure that LLMs understand handoffs properly, we recommend
including information about handoffs in your agents. We have a suggested
prefix in `agents.extensions.handoff_prompt.RECOMMENDED_PROMPT_PREFIX`,
or you can call
`agents.extensions.handoff_prompt.prompt_with_handoff_instructions` to
automatically add recommended data to your prompts.

``` python
from agents import Agent
from agents.extensions.handoff_prompt import RECOMMENDED_PROMPT_PREFIX

billing_agent = Agent(
    name="Billing agent",
    instructions=f"""{RECOMMENDED_PROMPT_PREFIX}
    <Fill in the rest of your prompt here>.""",
)
```

``` python
from agents.extensions.handoff_prompt import RECOMMENDED_PROMPT_PREFIX
RECOMMENDED_PROMPT_PREFIX
```

    '# System context\nYou are part of a multi-agent system called the Agents SDK, designed to make agent coordination and execution easy. Agents uses two primary abstraction: **Agents** and **Handoffs**. An agent encompasses instructions and tools and can hand off a conversation to another agent when appropriate. Handoffs are achieved by calling a handoff function, generally named `transfer_to_<agent_name>`. Transfers between agents are handled seamlessly in the background; do not mention or draw attention to these transfers in your conversation with the user.\n'
