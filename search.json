Useful for searching knowledge bases and retrieving specific data from APIs (e.g.¬†current weather data).\nTaking Action Perform actions like submitting a form, calling APIs, modifying application state (UI/frontend or backend), or taking agentic workflow actions (like handing off the conversation).\n\nfunction calling is different from hosted tools in terms of that hosted tools will be executed by OpenAI directly, while functions have to be executed by developers.

The models use these reasoning tokens to ‚Äúthink,‚Äù breaking down the prompt and considering multiple approaches to generating a response. After generating reasoning tokens, the model produces an answer as visible completion tokens and discards the reasoning tokens from its context.\n\n\nIf you‚Äôre managing context manually across model turns, you can discard older reasoning items unless you‚Äôre responding to a function call, in which case you must include all reasoning items between the function call and the last user message.\n\n\nKeeping reasoning items in context\nWhen doing function calling with a reasoning model in the Responses API, we highly recommend you pass back any reasoning items returned with the last function call (in addition to the output of your function). If the model calls multiple functions consecutively, you should pass back all reasoning items, function call items, and function call output items, since the last user message. This allows the model to continue its reasoning process to produce better results in the most token-efficient manner.\nThe simplest way to do this is to pass in all reasoning items from a previous response into the next one. Our systems will smartly ignore any reasoning items that aren‚Äôt relevant to your functions, and only retain those in context that are relevant. You can pass reasoning items from previous responses either using the previous_response_id parameter, or by manually passing in all the output items from a past response into the input of a new one.\nFor advanced use cases where you might be truncating and optimizing parts of the context window before passing them on to the next response, just ensure all items between the last user message and your function call output are passed into the next response untouched. This will ensure that the model has all the context it needs.\n\n\nReasoning summary\n\nprompt = \"\"\"\nWrite a bash script that takes a matrix represented as a string with \nformat '[1,2],[3,4],[5,6]' and prints the transpose in the same format.\n\"\"\"\n\nresponse = client.responses.create(\n    model=\"o4-mini\",\n    reasoning={\"effort\": \"medium\", \"summary\":\"auto\"},\n    input=[\n        {\n            \"role\": \"user\", \n            \"content\": prompt\n        }\n    ]\n)\n\n\nResponse(\n    id='resp_6870bf27e4d48196beb7ac469701c98d06e3e7d4c653bc6d',\n    created_at=1752219431.0,\n    model='o4-mini-2025-04-16',\n    object='response',\n    status='completed',\n    parallel_tool_calls=True,\n    temperature=1.0,\n    top_p=1.0,\n\n    # ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ INTERNAL REASONING ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ\n    output=[\n        ResponseReasoningItem(\n            id='rs_6870bf2849048196b23103f9583a7c6306e3e7d4c653bc6d',\n            type='reasoning',\n            summary=[\n                Summary(\n                    type='summary_text',\n                    text=(\n                        \"**Creating a bash script for matrix transposition**\\n\\n\"\n                        \"User needs a bash script to parse a matrix and print its transpose \"\n                        \"in the form \\\"[1,2],[3,4],[5,6]\\\" ‚Üí \\\"[1,3,5],[2,4,6]\\\".\\n\"\n                        \"Plan: split on '],[' then use awk or sed to transpose.\"\n                    )\n                ),\n                Summary(\n                    type='summary_text',\n                    text=(\n                        \"**Finalizing the bash script**\\n\\n\"\n                        \"Use awk to handle transposition, sed for input cleanup, \"\n                        \"and account for edge-case spaces.\"\n                    )\n                )\n            ]\n        ),\n\n        # ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ ASSISTANT REPLY ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ\n        ResponseOutputMessage(\n            id='msg_6870bf3dc3a48196902e8c7abfe0d23b06e3e7d4c653bc6d',\n            role='assistant',\n            status='completed',\n            type='message',\n            content=[\n                ResponseOutputText(\n                    type='output_text',\n                    text=(\n                        \"Here‚Äôs a self-contained **Bash script** that takes one argument‚Äîa matrix \"\n                        'like `\" [1,2],[3,4],[5,6] \"`‚Äîand prints its transpose in the same format:\\n\\n'\n                        \"```bash\\n\"\n                        \"#!/usr/bin/env bash\\n\\n\"\n                        \"# Usage check\\n\"\n                        \"if [ $# -ne 1 ]; then\\n\"\n                        \"  echo \\\"Usage: $0 '[1,2],[3,4],[5,6]'\\\" &gt;&2\\n\"\n                        \"  exit 1\\n\"\n                        \"fi\\n\\n\"\n                        \"input=\\\"$1\\\"\\n\\n\"\n                        \"# 1) Strip spaces, split rows on \\\"],[\\\", remove outer brackets\\n\"\n                        \"# 2) Feed rows to awk for the transpose\\n\"\n                        \"printf \\\"%s\\\" \\\"$input\\\" \\\\\\n\"\n                        \"  | sed -e 's/ //g' \\\\\\n\"\n                        \"        -e 's/],\\$begin:math:display$/\\\\\\\\n/g' \\\\\\\\\\\\n\"\n                        \"        -e 's/^\\\\\\\\[//' \\\\\\\\\\\\n\"\n                        \"        -e 's/\\\\$end:math:display$$//' \\\\\\n\"\n                        \"  | awk -F, '\\n\"\n                        \"{\\n\"\n                        \"  for (i = 1; i &lt;= NF; i++) mat[i, NR] = $i;\\n\"\n                        \"  if (NF &gt; ncols) ncols = NF;\\n\"\n                        \"  nrows = NR;\\n\"\n                        \"}\\n\"\n                        \"END {\\n\"\n                        \"  out = \\\"\\\";\\n\"\n                        \"  for (i = 1; i &lt;= ncols; i++) {\\n\"\n                        \"    out = out \\\"[\\\";\\n\"\n                        \"    for (j = 1; j &lt;= nrows; j++) {\\n\"\n                        \"      out = out mat[i, j] (j &lt; nrows ? \\\",\\\" : \\\"\\\");\\n\"\n                        \"    }\\n\"\n                        \"    out = out \\\"]\\\" (i &lt; ncols ? \\\",\\\" : \\\"\\\");\\n\"\n                        \"  }\\n\"\n                        \"  print out;\\n\"\n                        \"}'\\n\"\n                        \"```\\n\\n\"\n                        \"**Example run**\\n\"\n                        \"```bash\\n\"\n                        \"$ ./transpose.sh '[1,2],[3,4],[5,6]'\\n\"\n                        \"[1,3,5],[2,4,6]\\n\"\n                        \"```\\n\"\n                        \"**Key steps**\\n\"\n                        \"1.

    "text": "Response API - conversation state\n\nOpenAI provides a few ways to manage conversation state, which is important for preserving information across multiple messages or turns in a conversation.\n\n\nManually manage conversation state\n\nhistory = [\n    {\n        \"role\": \"user\",\n        \"content\": \"hello, nice to meet you. My name is Yunna\"\n    }\n]\n\nresponse = client.responses.create(\n    model=\"gpt-4o-mini\",\n    input=history,\n    store=False\n)\n\nprint(response.output_text)\n\n# Add the response to the conversation\nhistory += [{\"role\": el.role, \"content\": el.content} for el in response.output]\n\nhistory.append({ \"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"what is my name\" })\n\nsecond_response = client.responses.create(\n    model=\"gpt-4o-mini\",\n    input=history,\n    store=False\n)\n\nprint(second_response.output_text)\n\nHello, Yunna! It's great to meet you. How can I assist you today?\nYour name is Yunna. How can I help you today, Yunna?\n\n\n\n\nOpenAI APIs for conversation state\nOur APIs make it easier to manage conversation state automatically, so you don‚Äôt have to do pass inputs manually with each turn of a conversation.\nShare context across generated responses with the previous_response_id parameter. This parameter lets you chain responses and create a threaded conversation.\nIn the following example, we ask the model to tell a joke. Separately, we ask the model to explain why it‚Äôs funny, and the model has all necessary context to deliver a good response.\n\nresponse = client.responses.create(\n    model=\"gpt-4o-mini\",\n    input=\"hello, this is Yunna Speaking.

This max tokens number includes input, output, and reasoning tokens.\nAs your inputs become more complex, or you include more turns in a conversation, you‚Äôll need to consider both output token and context window limits. Model inputs and outputs are metered in tokens, which are parsed from inputs to analyze their content and intent and assembled to render logical outputs. Models have limits on token usage during the lifecycle of a text generation request.\n\nOutput tokens are the tokens generated by a model in response to a prompt. Each model has different limits for output tokens. For example, gpt-4o-2024-08-06 can generate a maximum of 16,384 output tokens.\nA context window describes the total tokens that can be used for both input and output tokens (and for some models, reasoning tokens). Compare the context window limits of our models. For example, gpt-4o-2024-08-06 has a total context window of 128k tokens.\n\nIf you create a very large prompt‚Äîoften by including extra context, data, or examples for the model‚Äîyou run the risk of exceeding the allocated context window for a model, which might result in truncated outputs.\nUse the tokenizer tool, built with the tiktoken library, to see how many tokens are in a particular string of text.\nFor example, when making an API request to the Responses API with a reasoning enabled model, like the o1 model, the following token counts will apply toward the context window total:\n\nInput tokens (inputs you include in the input array for the Responses API)\nOutput tokens (tokens generated in response to your prompt)\nReasoning tokens (used by the model to plan a response)\n\nTokens generated in excess of the context window limit may be truncated in API responses.",

Dolphins had begun to hum disquieting news from the deep trenches; albatrosses muttered of tropospheric wounds; the currents tasted fizzed and feverish. And so, one midnight when the Moon poured a silver highway over the swells, six clans of Lutrinae gathered on a barnacled shelf and voted‚Äîby shell-crack, splash, and hiss‚Äîto do the impossible:\n\n‚ÄúLeave the sea, leap the sky, seek kinder waters between the stars.‚Äù\n\nSuch is how an idea far larger than any raft of otters was born.\n\nPART ONE ‚Äì RAFT OF INGENUITY  \n1 ‚Äì The Spiral-Shell Pact  \nCaptain Shellbreaker, oldest and broadest of the southern sea-otters, thumped an abalone shell upon a driftwood podium. ‚ÄúWe go not as beasts in a cage of steel,‚Äù he declared, ‚Äúbut as otters: sleek, curious, playful, and stubborn as barnacles on basalt.‚Äù Neural-ink squids drew diagrams in living luminescence along the shoreline: spirals of paired habitats, tide-pool bioreactors, kelp-weave solar sails that unfurled like emerald banners. Overhead, the aurora shivered green applause.\n\n2 ‚Äì Moss and the Clockwork Clam  \nMoss, a river-otter engineer from the Salish sound, believed machinery should purr like lullabies. She built the Clockwork Clam, a fusion-ignitor whose tungsten valves clicked in a rhythm uncannily like a heartbeat. It promised thrust enough to fling fifty thousand kilograms of habitat past the Mesosphere. Still, it needed a guidance mind.\n\n3 ‚Äì Dr. Ripple‚Äôs Star-Script  \nDr. Ripple, scholar of hydrodynamics and astro-navigation, proposed to lace the vessel‚Äôs AI with actual water: a torus of conductive brine, pulsing ions carrying qubits the way rivers carry leaves. ‚ÄúThought,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúought to flow.‚Äù Thus the ship‚Äîchristened Lutra‚Äôs Leap‚Äîwould dream in ripples and tidal harmonics.\n\nPART TWO ‚Äì LEAVING THE BLUE DEN  \n4 ‚Äì The Day the Ocean Hung Suspended  \nLaunch towers rose like petrified kelp. Seals sang a dirge; gulls performed scattershot blessings (mostly involving guano). When the Clockwork Clam roared, plumes of steam enfolded the platform. Pup‚Äîthe youngest cadet‚Äîpressed her snout to a viewport. For a breathless interval Earth looked less like home and more like an egg cracked open to release them.\n\n5 ‚Äì In the Company of Micro-Stars  \nMicro-stars‚Äîfreckles of fusion plasma held in magnetic nets‚Äîlined the port corridor. Otter kits chased each other weightless, somersaulting through jewel-bright radiation bafflers. Play remained sacred protocol; Shellbreaker allowed five tumbling minutes every hour. ‚ÄúJoy is a rudder,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúLose it and you drift.‚Äù\n\nPART THREE ‚Äì BETWEEN CONSTELLATIONS  \n6 ‚Äì The First Dry Storm  \nSeventeen days outward, a storm of dust no rain could tame punched into the solar-sail lattice. Tensile cables snapped with twangs like harp-strings. Moss suited up, tail braced against a stanchion, and skittered along the honeycomb struts. With torch and fiber-knot she rewove light-scoop petals while cosmic grit rattled her visor. The stars, smeared and furious, seemed to threaten: ‚ÄúTurn back, river-spawn.‚Äù\n\n7 ‚Äì The Whale Made of Night  \nBeyond Mars orbit, long-range scanners painted a silhouette eighty kilometers from snout to fluke‚Äîa magnetovore leviathan drift-feeding on solar wind. It sang sub-audible roars that shivered the hull. Dr. Ripple routed those vibratos into water-logic, letting the ship hum an answering chord: a peace-song half lullaby, half puzzle. The whale tasted the meaning‚Äîcuriosity, not conquest‚Äîand slid aside, vanishing like ink in ink.\n\nPART FOUR ‚Äì THE LONG PLAY  \n8 ‚Äì The Game of Pebbles  \nMonths stretched. Food algae grew dull; morale sagged. Captain Shellbreaker ordered the Pebble Games. In zero-g arenas otters improvised billiards with polished meteorites. Strategies were mapped onto star charts; each rebound, a micro-lesson in orbital mechanics. Pup, formerly shy, revealed uncanny instinct: her last ricochet notched a win and recalculated the upcoming gravity assist in her head. Promotion followed: Navigation Apprentice.\n\n9 ‚Äì Letters in a Bottle  \nThough transmission lasers could whisper data across light-minutes, nostalgia demanded something slower. Glass bottles‚Äîtoughened to withstand vacuum‚Äîwere stuffed with sea-salt pages and set adrift toward Earth on ballistic arcs. None might ever reach shore, but faith floated with them. ‚ÄúEven if salt never touches tongue,‚Äù Moss mused, ‚Äústories know the way home.‚Äù\n\nPART FIVE ‚Äì THE BROKEN CURRENT  \n10 ‚Äì Sabotage at Perihelion  \nNot all paws were guiding the same tide. A faction calling itself the Deep-Traditionalists hacked coolant valves, intending to provoke failure and force return. The fusion heart faltered; lights browned; freezing fog crystallized on fur. In a dimmed corridor, Captain Shellbreaker confronted Flint, leader of the dissenters. Flint‚Äôs whiskers quivered: ‚ÄúWe belong in rivers, old one. The sky is a drought without end.‚Äù Shellbreaker offered him a river-stone worn smooth. ‚ÄúCarry it,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúRemember home‚Äîbut help us make new springs.‚Äù Flint, tears beading and drifting, surrendered.\n\n11 ‚Äì A Tail‚Äôs-Length from Oblivion  \nRepairs cost hard days. Radiation crept inward, sterilizing algae beds. Pup‚Äôs navigation suggested a detour: the comet Selkie-7, brimming with ice. A risky burn later, the Leap nestled her belly against the comet‚Äôs crystalline shore, harpoons locking on. They mined frozen volatiles, refilled tanks, and painted the ship‚Äôs name in bright kelp-green across the comet face, a graffiti bigger than some towns.\n\nPART SIX ‚Äì ARRIVAL AT NEREIDIA  \n12 ‚Äì The Ocean in the Gap Between Stars  \nThree years, two months, and eleven splashes since launch, telescopes finally resolved their destination: Nereidia, a waterworld circling Tau Ceti, girdled by archipelagos the color of abalone. As deceleration hammered them, pups (now lanky adolescents) lined up to watch the planet bloom‚Äîcascading storms, violet tides, moonlit surf untouched by paw or fin. New scent, new song.\n\n13 ‚Äì First Dive  \nAtmospheric shuttles splashed into a bay warm as soup. Salt different, gravity gentle. Moss wept as she realized the tools she‚Äôd carried were suddenly primitive here; new alloys awaited forging, new currents awaited reading. Dr. Ripple tasted a drop: ‚ÄúLess sodium, more magnesium. The water will think differently.‚Äù Captain Shellbreaker pronounced, ‚ÄúThen we must learn to think as it does.‚Äù\n\nPART SEVEN ‚Äì THE MAKING OF HOME  \n14 ‚Äì Rafts Reborn  \nRafts of woven kelp thicker than redwood trunks; hydroponic mangrove towers; tide-mills singing beside phosphorescent reefs‚Äîcivilization sprouted like coral. Games returned, so did lullabies, but now otter kits leapt through surf beneath twin moons. Flint, pardoned, built a temple of river-stones where homesick travelers could hold polished memories.\n\n15 ‚Äì The Council of Tides  \nDelegates met on a lagoon‚Äôs mirrored skin, debating whether to call more clans from Earth. Transmission windows opened. Holograms of Earth-otters shimmered: some grey-muzzled, some just born. ‚ÄúThere is room,‚Äù Pup‚Äînow Navigator General‚Äîsaid. ‚ÄúBut not for conquest. For kinship.‚Äù Votes lapped the lagoon‚Äôs edge like gentle waves. The Yes carried. Invitations rode light across twelve light-years.\n\nEPILOGUE ‚Äì RIPPLES WITHOUT END  \nGenerations hence, star-raft builders will speak of the night their ancestors cracked shells under moonlight and decided to fling themselves skyward on nothing sturdier than hope. Otter kits yet unborn will orbit twin suns and ask, ‚ÄúWas Earth real?‚Äù Elders will answer, ‚ÄúYes. As real as the next dream.‚Äù And somewhere, adrift between worlds, a bottle spins‚Äîinside, a note in uneven scrawl:\n\n‚ÄúWe left our rivers not to escape, but to widen them. Wherever water can flow, otters will follow. If you find this, follow too. There is so much left to splash upon.‚Äù\n\nThe bottle glitters, turns, and vanishes into the starry dark, while far ahead the River-Stars continue, endless, playful, and bright.\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\nCancelling a background response\n\nresp = client.responses.cancel(\"resp_123\")\n\nprint(resp.status)\n\n\n\nStreaming a background response\nYou can create a background Response and start streaming events from it right away. This may be helpful if you expect the client to drop the stream and want the option of picking it back up later. To do this, create a Response with both background and stream set to true. You will want to keep track of a ‚Äúcursor‚Äù corresponding to the sequence_number you receive in each streaming event.\n\n# Fire off an async response but also start streaming immediately\nstream = client.responses.create(\n  model=\"o3\",\n  input=\"Write a very long novel about otters in space.\",\n  background=True,\n  stream=True,\n)\n\ncursor = None\nfor event in stream:\n  print(event)\n  cursor = event.sequence_number\n\n# If your connection drops, the response continues running and you can reconnect:\n# SDK support for resuming the stream is coming soon.",

Please only use information from the websites that contains the Air New Zealand domain - https://www.airnewzealand.co.nz/\",\n    tools=[\n        WebSearchTool(),]\n)\n\nYou can run agents via the Runner class. You have 3 options:\n\nRunner.run(), which runs async and returns a RunResult.\nRunner.run_sync(), which is a sync method and just runs .run() under the hood.\nRunner.run_streamed(), which runs async and returns a RunResultStreaming. It calls the LLM in streaming mode, and streams those events to you as they are received.\n\n\nresult = await Runner.run(\n    agent,\n    \"I am flying from Melbourne to Auckland. My ticket class is seat-only. \"\n    \"How many bags can I check through?\"\n)\nprint(result.final_output)\n\nFor your flight from Melbourne to Auckland with a Seat fare, you are entitled to one carry-on bag weighing up to 7kg (15lb), along with one small personal item, such as a handbag or thin laptop bag. ([airnewzealand.com](https://www.airnewzealand.com/carry-on-baggage?utm_source=openai)) Checked baggage is not included with the Seat fare. If you require checked baggage, you can upgrade to a Seat+Bag fare, which includes one checked bag up to 23kg (50lb). ([airnewzealand.co.nz](https://www.airnewzealand.co.nz/short-haul-fares?utm_source=openai)) \n\n\n\nRunning the agent aka - the agent loop\nWhen you use the run method in Runner, you pass in a starting agent and input. The input can either be a string (which is considered a user message), or a list of input items, which are the items in the OpenAI Responses API.\nThe runner then runs a loop:\nWe call the LLM for the current agent, with the current input. The LLM produces its output.\n\nIf the LLM returns a final_output, the loop ends and we return the result.\nIf the LLM does a handoff, we update the current agent and input, and re-run the loop.\nIf the LLM produces tool calls, we run those tool calls, append the results, and re-run the loop.\n\nIf we exceed the max_turns passed, we raise a MaxTurnsExceeded exception.\n\nConfigurations when running the agent\nThe run_config parameter lets you configure some global settings for the agent run:\n\nmodel: Allows setting a global LLM model to use, irrespective of what model each Agent has.\nmodel_provider: A model provider for looking up model names, which defaults to OpenAI.\nmodel_settings: Overrides agent-specific settings. For example, you can set a global temperature or top_p.\ninput_guardrails, output_guardrails: A list of input or output guardrails to include on all runs.\nhandoff_input_filter: A global input filter to apply to all handoffs, if the handoff doesn‚Äôt already have one. The input filter allows you to edit the inputs that are sent to the new agent. See the documentation in Handoff.input_filter for more details.\ntracing_disabled: Allows you to disable tracing for the entire run.\ntrace_include_sensitive_data: Configures whether traces will include potentially sensitive data, such as LLM and tool call inputs/outputs.\nworkflow_name, trace_id, group_id: Sets the tracing workflow name, trace ID and trace group ID for the run. We recommend at least setting workflow_name. The group ID is an optional field that lets you link traces across multiple runs.\ntrace_metadata: Metadata to include on all traces.\n\n\n\nConversations/chat threads\nCalling any of the run methods can result in one or more agents running (and hence one or more LLM calls), but it represents a single logical turn in a chat conversation. For example:\n\nUser turn: user enter text\nRunner run: first agent calls LLM, runs tools, does a handoff to a second agent, second agent runs more tools, and then produces an output.\n\nAt the end of the agent run, you can choose what to show to the user. For example, you might show the user every new item generated by the agents, or just the final output.

    "text": "Expand the agent capabilities with ‚Äúcontext‚Äù\nContext is an overloaded term. There are two main classes of context you might care about:\n\nContext available locally to your code: this is data and dependencies you might need when tool functions run, during callbacks like on_handoff, in lifecycle hooks, etc.\nContext available to LLMs: this is data the LLM sees when generating a response.\n\nLocal context\nThis is represented via the RunContextWrapper class and the context property within it. The way this works is:\n\nYou create any Python object you want. A common pattern is to use a dataclass or a Pydantic object.\nYou pass that object to the various run methods (e.g.¬†Runner.run(‚Ä¶, context=whatever)).\nAll your tool calls, lifecycle hooks etc will be passed a wrapper object, RunContextWrapper[T], where T represents your context object type which you can access via wrapper.context.\n\nThe most important thing to be aware of: every agent, tool function, lifecycle etc for a given agent run must use the same type of context.\nYou can use the context for things like:\n\nContextual data for your run (e.g.¬†things like a username/uid or other information about the user)\nDependencies (e.g.¬†logger objects, data fetchers, etc)\nHelper functions\n\n\nimport asyncio\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\n\nfrom agents import Agent, RunContextWrapper, Runner, function_tool\n\n@dataclass\nclass UserInfo:  \n    name: str\n    uid: int\n\n@function_tool\nasync def fetch_user_age(wrapper: RunContextWrapper[UserInfo]) -&gt; str:  \n    \"\"\"Fetch the age of the user.

This means that if you want to make some new data available to the LLM, you must do it in a way that makes it available in that history. There are a few ways to do this:\n\nYou can add it to the Agent instructions. This is also known as a ‚Äúsystem prompt‚Äù or ‚Äúdeveloper message‚Äù. System prompts can be static strings, or they can be dynamic functions that receive the context and output a string. This is a common tactic for information that is always useful (for example, the user‚Äôs name or the current date).\nAdd it to the input when calling the Runner.run functions. This is similar to the instructions tactic, but allows you to have messages that are lower in the chain of command.\nExpose it via function tools. This is useful for on-demand context - the LLM decides when it needs some data, and can call the tool to fetch that data.\nUse retrieval or web search. These are special tools that are able to fetch relevant data from files or databases (retrieval), or from the web (web search). This is useful for ‚Äúgrounding‚Äù the response in relevant contextual data.",

For example, imagine you have an agent that uses a very smart (and hence slow/expensive) model to help with customer requests. You wouldn‚Äôt want malicious users to ask the model to help them with their math homework. So, you can run a guardrail with a fast/cheap model.

Using the Traces dashboard, you can debug, visualize, and monitor your workflows during development and in production.\nTracing is enabled by default. There are two ways to disable tracing:\n\nYou can globally disable tracing by setting the env var OPENAI_AGENTS_DISABLE_TRACING=1\nYou can disable tracing for a single run by setting agents.run.RunConfig.tracing_disabled to True\n\n\nFor organizations operating under a Zero Data Retention (ZDR) policy using OpenAI‚Äôs APIs, tracing is unavailable.\n\nBy default, the SDK traces the following:\n\nThe entire Runner.{run, run_sync, run_streamed}() is wrapped in a trace().\nEach time an agent runs, it is wrapped in agent_span()\nLLM generations are wrapped in generation_span()\nFunction tool calls are each wrapped in function_span()\nGuardrails are wrapped in guardrail_span()\nHandoffs are wrapped in handoff_span()\nAudio inputs (speech-to-text) are wrapped in a transcription_span()\nAudio outputs (text-to-speech) are wrapped in a speech_span()\nRelated audio spans may be parented under a speech_group_span()\nBy default, the trace is named ‚ÄúAgent trace‚Äù.

These may contain sensitive data, so you can disable capturing that data via RunConfig.trace_include_sensitive_data.\nSimilarly, Audio spans include base64-encoded PCM data for input and output audio by default. You can disable capturing this audio data by configuring VoicePipelineConfig.trace_include_sensitive_audio_data.\n\n\n\nCustom tracing processors\nThe high level architecture for tracing is:\n\nAt initialization, we create a global TraceProvider, which is responsible for creating traces. We configure the TraceProvider with a BatchTraceProcessor that sends traces/spans in batches to a BackendSpanExporter, which exports the spans and traces to the OpenAI backend in batches. To customize this default setup, to send traces to alternative or additional backends or modifying exporter behavior, you have two options:\nadd_trace_processor() lets you add an additional trace processor that will receive traces and spans as they are ready. This lets you do your own processing in addition to sending traces to OpenAI‚Äôs backend.\nset_trace_processors() lets you replace the default processors with your own trace processors. This means traces will not be sent to the OpenAI backend unless you include a TracingProcessor that does so.",

This is particularly useful in scenarios where different agents specialize in distinct areas. For example, a customer support app might have agents that each specifically handle tasks like order status, refunds, FAQs, etc.\nHandoffs are represented as tools to the LLM. So if there‚Äôs a handoff to an agent named Refund Agent, the tool would be called transfer_to_refund_agent.\n\n\n# Basic usage\nfrom agents import Agent, handoff\n\nbilling_agent = Agent(name=\"Billing agent\")\nrefund_agent = Agent(name=\"Refund agent\")\n\n\ntriage_agent = Agent(name=\"Triage agent\", handoffs=[billing_agent, handoff(refund_agent)])\n\n\n\nCustomizing handoffs via the handoff() function\nThe handoff() function lets you customize things.\n\nagent: This is the agent to which things will be handed off.\ntool_name_override: By default, the Handoff.default_tool_name() function is used, which resolves to transfer_to_. You can override this.\ntool_description_override: Override the default tool description from Handoff.default_tool_description()\non_handoff: A callback function executed when the handoff is invoked. This is useful for things like kicking off some data fetching as soon as you know a handoff is being invoked. This function receives the agent context, and can optionally also receive LLM generated input. The input data is controlled by the input_type param.\ninput_type: The type of input expected by the handoff (optional).\ninput_filter: This lets you filter the input received by the next agent. See below for more.\n\n\nfrom agents import Agent, handoff, RunContextWrapper\n\ndef on_handoff(ctx: RunContextWrapper[None]):\n    print(\"Handoff called\")\n\nagent = Agent(name=\"My agent\")\n\nhandoff_obj = handoff(\n    agent=agent,\n    on_handoff=on_handoff,\n    tool_name_override=\"custom_handoff_tool\",\n    tool_description_override=\"Custom description\",\n)\n\n\n\nHand-off inputs\nIn certain situations, you want the LLM to provide some data when it calls a handoff. For example, imagine a handoff to an ‚ÄúEscalation agent‚Äù. You might want a reason to be provided, so you can log it.\n\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel\n\nfrom agents import Agent, handoff, RunContextWrapper\n\nclass EscalationData(BaseModel):\n    reason: str\n\nasync def on_handoff(ctx: RunContextWrapper[None], input_data: EscalationData):\n    print(f\"Escalation agent called with reason: {input_data.reason}\")\n\nagent = Agent(name=\"Escalation agent\")\n\nhandoff_obj = handoff(\n    agent=agent,\n    on_handoff=on_handoff,\n    input_type=EscalationData,\n)\n\n\n\nInput filters\nWhen a handoff occurs, it‚Äôs as though the new agent takes over the conversation, and gets to see the entire previous conversation history. If you want to change this, you can set an input_filter. An input filter is a function that receives the existing input via a HandoffInputData, and must return a new HandoffInputData.\nThere are some common patterns (for example removing all tool calls from the history), which are implemented for you in agents.extensions.handoff_filters\n\nfrom agents import Agent, handoff\nfrom agents.extensions import handoff_filters\n\nagent = Agent(name=\"FAQ agent\")\n\nhandoff_obj = handoff(\n    agent=agent,\n    input_filter=handoff_filters.remove_all_tools, \n)\n\n\n\nHandpff prompts\nTo make sure that LLMs understand handoffs properly, we recommend including information about handoffs in your agents. We have a suggested prefix in agents.extensions.handoff_prompt.RECOMMENDED_PROMPT_PREFIX, or you can call agents.extensions.handoff_prompt.prompt_with_handoff_instructions to automatically add recommended data to your prompts.\n\nfrom agents import Agent\nfrom agents.extensions.handoff_prompt import RECOMMENDED_PROMPT_PREFIX\n\nbilling_agent = Agent(\n    name=\"Billing agent\",\n    instructions=f\"\"\"{RECOMMENDED_PROMPT_PREFIX}\n    &lt;Fill in the rest of your prompt here&gt;.\"\"\",\n)\n\n\nfrom agents.extensions.handoff_prompt import RECOMMENDED_PROMPT_PREFIX\nRECOMMENDED_PROMPT_PREFIX\n\n'# System context\\nYou are part of a multi-agent system called the Agents SDK, designed to make agent coordination and execution easy. Agents uses two primary abstraction: **Agents** and **Handoffs**. An agent encompasses instructions and tools and can hand off a conversation to another agent when appropriate. Handoffs are achieved by calling a handoff function, generally named `transfer_to_&lt;agent_name&gt;`. Transfers between agents are handled seamlessly in the background; do not mention or draw attention to these transfers in your conversation with the user.\\n'",
